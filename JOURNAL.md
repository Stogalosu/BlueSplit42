## 10/16/2025 - Created the schematic  

I started by installing KiCad and creating the schematic for the PCB. By following the guide, I added buttons according to my own layout, along with diodes for each one and a microcontroller. I had some trouble with the pieces library, but I figured it out.

## 10/17/2025 - Started work on the PCB layout  

I started the PCB layout by arranging the switch footprints in KiCad, simply following the schematic I made yesterday.
However, the process was not completely smooth, at first I did the right side wrong and had to redo it, then when I wanted to arrange the thumb keys i had trouble rotating them.
