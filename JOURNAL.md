## 10/16/2025 - Created the schematic  

I started by installing KiCad and creating the schematic for the PCB. By following the guide, I added buttons according to my own layout, along with diodes for each one and a microcontroller. I had some trouble with the pieces library, but I figured it out.

## 10/17/2025 - Started work on the PCB layout  

I started the PCB layout by arranging the switch footprints in KiCad, simply following the schematic I made yesterday.
However, the process was not completely smooth, at first I did the right side wrong and had to redo it, then when I wanted to arrange the thumb keys i had trouble rotating them.

## 10/19/2025 - Finished the PCB  

Today, I arranged the diodes for each switch, then I routed the whole PCB. I also placed some footprints for the pins that connect to the battery and the mounting holes.
This time, i had trouble because initially I routed the pinholes to the microcontroller instead of the hotswap sockets, so I had to redo most of the wiring. Also, rotating the thumb keys almost gave me a headache again.
