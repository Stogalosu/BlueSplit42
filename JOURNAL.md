## 10/16/2025 - Created the schematic  

I started by installing KiCad and creating the schematic for the PCB. By following the guide, I added buttons according to my own layout, along with diodes for each one and a microcontroller. I had some trouble with the pieces library, but I figured it out.

## 10/17/2025 - Started work on the PCB layout  

I started the PCB layout by arranging the switch footprints in KiCad, simply following the schematic I made yesterday.
However, the process was not completely smooth, at first I did the right side wrong and had to redo it, then when I wanted to arrange the thumb keys i had trouble rotating them.

## 10/19/2025 - Finished the PCB  

Today, I arranged the diodes for each switch, then I routed the whole PCB. I also placed some footprints for the pins that connect to the battery and the mounting holes.
This time, i had trouble because initially I routed the pinholes to the microcontroller instead of the hotswap sockets, so I had to redo most of the wiring. Also, rotating the thumb keys almost gave me a headache again.

## 10/25/2025 - Started designing the case  

I started designing the case for the keyboard in Fusion 360. Fortunately, I already know how to use Fusion, so it isn't that hard. I still have to figure out how to hold the whole thing together.

## 10/26/2025 - Redid the PCB  

I realized that the switch sockets were on the wrong side, so I had to redesign the PCB. This time, I used a autorouting plugin to make the wiring quicker. I also made a panelized version, to check if it's cheaper this way (it isn't). While I was at it, I also fixed some outlines that weren't at the right angles.

## 10/30/2025 - Finished the case  

After redesigning the PCB, I completely redesigned the case as well. It has two parts: the bottom one, which holds the battery and has the opening for the USB C port and the top one, that also acts as a mount plate for the switches. Everything is held together by 3 M3 screws. Initially, I used M2 screws, but I realized the threads were kind of small to be 3d printed. I also added an incline to the case for comfort.
