# Bluesplit42
## What?(description)
Bluesplit42 is a split custom mechanical keyboard built entirely by me, except for the switches and keycaps. It will be a 40% layout with 42 keys, thus the 42 in the name.
It will have linear switches and pom jelly keycaps, because I've always wanted those but they were too expensive (now they're on sale). For the firmware, I'm using ZMK

## But Why?
Simply because i love mechanical keyboards. I just love them. Plus, this event is a great way to get a keyboard that would otherwise be very expensive for my budget. Did I mention I love keyboards?

**Full PCB with mousebites** (this is not in my cart because it's actually more expensive than buying the 2 pcbs separately, by a few cents, but still)
